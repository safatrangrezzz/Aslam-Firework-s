                    Always use fireworks outdoors in an open and safe area away from homes,
                    vehicles, trees and electric wires.
                </li>

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Children should never handle fireworks alone — adult supervision is mandatory.
                </li>

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Maintain a minimum distance of 10 feet after lighting any firework.
                </li>

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Never relight, touch, or approach a firework that fails to ignite.
                </li>

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Keep a bucket of water, sand or a fire extinguisher nearby for emergencies.
                </li>

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Avoid loose or synthetic clothing. Cotton wear is the safest option.

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Always read and follow the instructions on every firework product.

                    Store fireworks in a cool, dry place — away from flames and heat.

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Pour water on burnt fireworks before disposing of them safely.
